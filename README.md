## Information about the purpose of the project, description of its functionality, how to build the project, etc

## Skills Assessed
- Following directions accurately
- Learning to restructure project files into relevant directories and sub-directories in accordance with best practices
- Modifying source code and importing necessary modules to pass tests
- Reading and running tests
- Practicing with using Git to collaborate and maintain code

## Goal
A calculator is a powerful tool. You can use it to do calculations such as additions, divisions, multiplications, and subtractions. In this project, you will be modifying functions in the source code for them to perform these calculations with given inputs. Then you'll be running the tests provided to test your source code. You'll also be restructuring the files in this project according to best practices and practicing using Git to collaborate and maintain your code.

## Details About How to Run Tests
1. Find the test file that contains the test you want to run.
   1. Check the `tests` folder, and find the test file you want to run
2. Run the test for your specific file with: 
    pytest file.py
    
    replace "file" with the name of the specific file. 
3. TO run all tests in this project pytest in the terminal. 
    pytest
   
## Project Write-Up: How to Complete and Submit
 The goal of this project is to write code in the project file structure folder so that each of its functions meet the requirements in the Project Directions below. 

 Go through each file one-by-one, and complete the functions. 

 Use the tests to drive your development 

## Project Directions
Please run each of the tests in the tests directory, read the error message(s) if there are any, and modify the corresponding source code file (e.g., the addition.py file corresponds to the test_addition.py file) by, for example, importing the necessary modules, to pass the test. Please refer to the "Details about How to Run Tests" section above for more information on how to run tests.
